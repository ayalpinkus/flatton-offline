Release 1.1
1. Added this changelog.
2. If no files are passed on the command line, the executable wills assume flats.png output and lines.png input. Added this for Windows users, so they can just place a file lines.png in the same folder and double-click on the executable.
3. Ask user to press enter after an error, so people can see the error before clicking away a command prompt.
